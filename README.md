# homebridge-eveatmo

This is a [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) plugin which lets you integrate your non-HomeKit Netatmo Weatherstation into HomeKit.

Whilst the original [homebridge-netatmo](https://github.com/planetk/homebridge-netatmo)-plugin goes a mostly HomeKit-standard approach (predefined services, characteristics, ...), this plugin tries to mimic the Elgato Eve devices (currently *Room* and *Weather*) as close as possible. 

Because this is a work-in-progress project which is neither feature-complete nor fully testet this readme is more of a stub. No setup instructions, no configuration-advices. Use at your own risk

## thanks

This plugin's basic structure and most of its basic code is a fork (ok, lets say "copy") of [homebridge-netatmo](https://github.com/planetk/homebridge-netatmo). So big thanks to @planetk and all the other contributors of this project.
